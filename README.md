# PokeDex-VanillaJS
PokeDex with Poke API in Vanilla JS for training.

I created this project to train myself to manipulate data from an API by fetching the data I was interested in and then searching for it according to certain criteria with inputs filled in by the user.

This project was created in HTML/CSS/Javascript.
